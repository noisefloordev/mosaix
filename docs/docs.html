<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>See "Test scene\Demo scene.unity" for an example.
<ul>
<li>In the inspector, Layer -&gt; Add Layer, and create a layer to mosaic.<br>
<img src="images/Setup_AddLayer.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%;">
</li>
</li>
<li>Select your camera and add Component → Effects → Mosaix.</li>
<li>Set "Mosaic Layer" to the layer you created.</li>
<li>Put objects to mosaic in the new layer.<br>
<img src="images/Setup_PutMeshInLayer.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%;">
<li>Play the scene.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sphere masks</h2>
<p>To use sphere masks, enable <strong>Sphere masking</strong>, and connect a 3D sphere to <strong>Masking Sphere</strong>.
Place the sphere, and parent it correctly so it follows the object to be pixelated.  Once the
sphere is placed, disable its Mesh Renderer so the sphere isn't visible.
<p>The sphere can be scaled and rotated to cover oblong areas.  The <strong>Sphere Collider</strong> component should
be deleted from the sphere, so objects don't collide with it.
<p><strong>Mask Fade</strong> can be set to fade the mosaic away smoothly outside the sphere.  At 0, the
mosaic cuts off sharply at the edge of the sphere.
<h2>Texture masks</h2>
To mask with a texture, enable <strong>Texture masking</strong>, and select a <strong>Masking Texture</strong>.
White areas in the mask will be pixelated and black ones won't.  The masking texture will
use the same UVs as the models being rendered.
<p>This works best if the masking layer only contains a single object, since this
only uses a single texture.
<h2>Anchoring</h2>
<p>To use anchoring, connect a transform to <strong>Anchor</strong>, then enable <strong>Follow Anchor</strong> or
<strong>Scale mosaic size</strong>.
<p>If <strong>Follow Anchor</strong> is enabled, the mosaic lines follow the anchor as it moves around
on screen.
<p>If <strong>Scale mosaic size</strong> is enabled, the mosaic will also scale itself as the anchor gets
further and closer to the camera.  This allows the mosaic to be smaller when the object is
far from the camera and finer as the object is closer to the camera.
<h2>Integrating with cartoon outline shaders</h2>
See <strong>DemoUnityChan.unity</strong> for an example of integrating toon shader outlines on
top of the mosaic shader.  The
<a href=https://github.com/noisefloordev/mosaix/blob/master/Assets/Mosaix/DemoUnityChan/Shaders/UnityChanSkinMosaic.shader>
UnityChanSkinMosaic</a> shader invokes the mosaic shader with <code>UsePass "FX/Mosaix/MOSAIC"</code>.
A material using this shader is then assigned to <strong>Mosaic Material</strong> in place of
Mosaic.mat.
<h2>Multiple mosaics</h2>
<p>To mosaic two objects separately, add a second Mosaix script to your camera, and use it
with a separate layer.  The objects won't bleed together, and can use different settings,
such as a different number of mosaic blocks.
<h2>All settings</h2>
<p><strong>Mosaic Layer</strong> The display layer to mosaic.<br>
<strong>Mosaic Blocks</strong> The number of mosaic blocks.  Higher numbers give smaller mosaic blocks.
<p><strong>Masking/Texture masking</strong> If enabled, the mosaic will be masked using a texture.<br>
<strong>Masking/Masking Texture</strong> If <strong>Texture masking</strong> is enabled, this is the texture to use as a mask.<br>
<strong>Masking/Sphere masking</strong> If enabled, the mosaic will only display within a bounding sphere.<br>
<strong>Masking/Masking Sphere</strong> If <strong>Sphere masking</strong> is enabled, this is the sphere to use as a mask.<br>
<strong>Masking/Mask Fade</strong> If <strong>Sphere masking</strong> is enabled, this is how smoothly to fade out the mosaic outside the sphere.
<p><strong>Anchoring/Anchor</strong> A transform to use as a mosaic anchor, if desired.<br>
<strong>Anchoring/Follow Anchor</strong> If enabled, the mosaic will follow the anchor around on screen instead of being fixed in place.<br>
<strong>Anchoring/Scale mosaic size</strong> If enabled, the mosaic will get bigger as the anchor gets closer to the camera.
<p><strong>Advanced Settings/Shadows Cast On Mosaic</strong> Whether other objects cast shadows on the mosaic.  Turning this
off may be faster, but may look wrong depending on your scene's lighting.<br>
<strong>Advanced Settings/High Resolution Render</strong> A high-quality mode is used to render the mosaic.
This results in less flicker as objects move, more accurate lighting, and is required
for masking and alpha.<br>
<strong>Advanced Settings/Alpha</strong> Fade out the mosaic.  This can be animated to transition the mosaic on and off smoothly.<br>
<strong>Advanced Settings/Render Scale</strong> How far to render offscreen for creating the mosaic.  A value of 1.1 is
recommended.
<p><strong>Shaders/Mosaic Material</strong> The material to use when rendering the mosaic.  This is usually <strong>Mosaix/Shaders/Mosaic.mat</strong>,
but can be set to another material to layer other effects on top of the mosaic.<br>
<strong>Shaders/Resize Shader</strong> This should be set to <strong>Mosaix/Shaders/Resize.shader</strong>.<br>
<strong>Shaders/Expand Edges Shader</strong> This should be set to <strong>Mosaix/Shaders/ExpandEdges.shader</strong>.
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Transparent objects aren't supported.
