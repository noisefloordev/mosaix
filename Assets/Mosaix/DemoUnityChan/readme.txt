To load this scene, import the free Unity-chan asset from the asset store:

https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18705

If the shader appears pink after first importing the asset, right-click DemoUnityChan
in the project and select "reimport all".  This works around a bug where the shader
isn't recompiled after the necessary shaders are imported from the asset.

For a simpler example scene, see Assets/Mosaix/Demo.
